<p class="meta">12 July 2017 - San Diego</p>

I have in the past, tried to maintain a blog, and write whenever I am able, I have never been able to find the sweet spot of consistency and continuous source of inspiration. Part of it has been work commitment, a lot of travel, and too less time to introspect and straighten out priorities. Fortunately, I recently started traveling more for leisure which allowed me to give more time to myself and straighten out my priorities rather than just blindly go through the rut of the routine. As a consequence, I also read more, and one of recent books I read was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081298840X" target="_blank">When Breath Becomes Air</a> by late <a href="http://paulkalanithi.com/" target="_blank">Paul Kalanithi</a>, which was instrumental in making me think about what's important to me. Though, I love what I do, and I am quite passionate about adding value through technology in any way possible, I still think this is not it, there is more to my existence and finding the purpose of my being is of paramount importance. 

I realized, I love writing and creative expression in any form. And it was a no brainer that I need phoenixing my blog and write some more for my own sake. So, here I am writing, sharing my thoughts, phoenixing my blog, phoenixing myself. 

P.S. - I have been an ardent follower of Tom Preston-Werner right from the beginning of his Gihub days. And I shamelessly copied the layout of his <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> and made it my own. The content and contribution is nowhere near what he has done, but the effort will be no less, I promise. Thanks to people like him, who make technology worthy and passion for coding alive for the rest of us. 

Here's a picture of an oblivious llama chomping grass at the Machu Picchu from my recent trip to Peru.

Buenas noches.
